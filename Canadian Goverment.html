  <p> The Canadian government has introduced and approached reconciliation with indigenous peoples through various policies, initiatives, and efforts over the years. The goals of reconciliation in Canada have primarily centered around addressing historical injustices, improving the well-being of indigenous communities, fostering cultural preservation, and promoting self-determination. While progress has been made, significant challenges and unmet goals remain. and this is the Canadian government's approach to reconciliation.
